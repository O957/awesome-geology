# Awesome Geology [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

_A curated list of awesome resources for geology._

<details markdown=1>

<summary> Definition From Wikipedia </summary>

> **Geology** is a branch of [natural science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science") concerned with the Earth and other [astronomical bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_bodies "Astronomical bodies"), the rocks of which they are composed, and the processes by which they change over time. [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology#cite_note-Geology_Definition-1)] The name comes from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language") [γῆ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%E1%BF%86#Ancient_Greek "wikt:γῆ") *(*gê*)* 'earth' and [λoγία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-#Ancient_Greek "wikt:-") *(*[-logía](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy "-logy")*)* 'study of, discourse'. [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology#cite_note-OnlineEtDict-2)] [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology#cite_note-LSJ-3)] Modern geology significantly overlaps all other [Earth sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science "Earth science"), including [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"). It is integrated with [Earth system science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_system_science "Earth system science") and [planetary science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science "Planetary science").
